This project is made completely by MLE_qwq. All rights reserved.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** 
1. I put the **WRONG** QQ number in the program and unfortunately I lost its source code therefore I can't correct that thing. The correct number is 482284091 (**NOT** 482284096, which is mentioned in the program).
2. The instructions inside the program are written in Chinese, which may not be suitable for everyone. Plus, the devices whose default ANSI coding is not Chinese may not be able to display texts normally.
3. The feature "window transparency" is enabled by default, which may make some windows look abnormal. In order to turn this feature off, drag its interval to 0 on the second page of the settings.
4. When the hiding hotkey and the showing hotkey are set to the same value, a glitch will happen. So try to set different values for them.
5. MLEBosskey detects whether the hotkeys are pressed down or not by checking the keys on your keyboard instead of registering a hotkey for real, which causes other programs that also use the same hotkeys to be triggered as well when pressing the hotkeys down.
   
**How to use**
1. Adding other programs to the list
   You can choose to add a specific progress name, window title or PID to the list so that MLEBosskey could know what windows it needs to hide.

2. Hiding windows
   Press down a specific hotkey and MLEBosskey will hide the windows following an order according to the list.
   The default hotkey for hiding is Ctrl+Q.

3. Showing windows
   Press down another specific hotkey and MLEBosskey will show the windows that were hidden.
   The default hotkey for showing is Ctrl+W.
   **Note:** Ctrl+W is also a hotkey for some programs such as browsers and document editing programs to close the current page it's opening. While using Ctrl+W as the showing hotkey, these programs will be triggered as well when you press the hotkey down.
   **Hint:** If you've forgotten the showing hotkey and you have important work whose windows are hidden, create a file named 'EmergencyShow.txt' under the directory where MLEBosskey is, and it'll show all hidden windows and quits afterward.

4. Force close
   Press down another specific hotkey and MLEBosskey will kill the windows that are in the list.
   The default hotkey for force closing is Ctrl+K.
   **Note:** This feature may lag depending on the windows in the list, so it's better to hide the windows first and force closing them afterward.

5. Showing/Hiding MLEBosskey itself
   To hide the main window of MLEBosskey, simply close the window and it'll keep running in the background.
   To show the main window of MLEBosskey, press down a specific hotkey. The default hotkey for this is Ctrl+M.

6. Transparency
   This feature allows you to make the windows in the list transparent according to the settings.
   This feature is on by default, but it may make some windows look abnormal. To turn this feature off, drag its interval to 0 on the settings page, as I said in the important notes.
   The settings page for this feature is at the second tab of the settings window.

That's everything you'll need to know so far. Thanks for your support.
